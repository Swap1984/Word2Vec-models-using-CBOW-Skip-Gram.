# Word2Vec-models-using-CBOW-Skip-Gram.
A clean walkthrough of text preprocessing, tokenization, and training Word2Vec models using CBOW &amp; Skip-Gram. Includes visualizations, evaluation, and embedding exploration for NLP projects.
🚀 New Project Added: Word Embeddings with Word2Vec (Gensim)
This end-to-end pipeline project demonstrates text cleaning, tokenization, Word2Vec (CBOW & Skip-Gram), embedding visualization, and model evaluation.
This project strengthened my conceptual understanding of how distributed word representations power modern NLP applications.
